## âœ… Build Complete!

Your DiscoverIT Scanner installer has been successfully built and is ready for deployment!

## ðŸ“¦ Package Contents

The `DiscoverIT-Scanner-Package` folder contains:
- **`DiscoverIT-Scanner-Installer.exe`** (20.5 MB) - Main installer executable
- **`README.md`** - Overview and features
- **`INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`** - Detailed installation instructions
- **`DEPLOYMENT_SUMMARY.md`** - Complete deployment guide

## ðŸ”‘ Credential Requirements

### **Yes, you need credentials from the main application:**

#### **Required Credentials:**
1. **Main Instance URL** - The URL of your DiscoverIT server
   - Example: `http://192.168.1.100:8000` or `https://discoverit.company.com`

2. **API Key** - Authentication token for the scanner
   - This needs to be generated from your main DiscoverIT instance
   - The scanner uses this to register and communicate with the main instance

#### **How to Get the API Key:**

1. **Access your main DiscoverIT instance** (web interface)
2. **Go to Admin Settings** â†’ **API Keys** (or similar section)
3. **Create a new API key** specifically for scanner services
4. **Copy the API key** - you'll need it during installation

#### **Alternative: Generate API Key via API**
```bash
# If you have admin access to the main instance
curl -X POST "http://your-discoverit-instance:8000/api/v2/auth/token" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"username": "admin", "password": "your-admin-password"}'
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Next Steps

### **1. Test the Installer (Recommended)**
- Copy `DiscoverIT-Scanner-Installer.exe` to a test Windows machine
- Run as Administrator
- Use your main DiscoverIT instance details
- Verify the scanner appears in your main instance

### **2. Deploy to Production**
- Distribute the installer to target Windows machines
- Ensure each machine has network access to your main DiscoverIT instance
- Use the same API key for all scanners (or create separate keys for each)

### **3. Monitor Deployment**
- Check the main DiscoverIT web interface
- Go to **Admin Settings** â†’ **Scanner Configs**
- Verify all scanners are registered and showing as "online"

## ðŸ”§ Installation Process

- **Automatic Updates**: Notifies main server when networks change
- **Zero Configuration**: No manual subnet entry required

### **Verification:**

## ðŸš¨ Important Notes

### **Network Requirements:**
- **Outbound**: Scanner â†’ Main instance (for API calls)

### **Firewall:**
- Windows Firewall rules are automatically configured
- Ensure corporate firewalls allow the required connections

### **Security:**
- API keys should be treated as passwords
- Store securely and rotate regularly
- Use HTTPS for main instance if possible
